    """
    Trace the boundary of a set of 2D points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : (Mx2) array
        The coordinates of the points.
    ransac_threshold : float
        Maximum distance for a data point to be classified as an inlier during
        the RANSAC line fitting.
    max_error : float
        The maximum error (distance) a point can have to a computed line.
    alpha : float
        Set to determine the boundary points using an alpha shape using this
        chosen alpha. If both alpha and k are set both methods will be used and
        the resulting shapes merged to find the boundary points.
    k : int
        Set to determine the boundary points using a knn based concave hull
        algorithm using this amount of nearest neighbors. If both alpha and k
        are set both methods will be used and the resulting shapes merged to
        find the boundary points.
    num_points : int, optional
        The number of points a segment needs to be supported by to be
        considered a primary orientation. Will be ignored if primary
        orientations are set manually.
    angle_epsilon : float
        The angle (in radians) difference within two angles are considered the
        same. Used to merge segments.
    merge_distance : float
        If the distance between two parallel sequential segments (based on the
        angle epsilon) is lower than this value the segments get merged.
    primary_orientations : list of floats, optional
        The desired primary orientations (in radians) of the boundary. If set
        manually here these orientations will not be computed.
    perp_dist_weight : float
        Used during the computation of the intersections between the segments.
        If the distance between the intersection of two segments and the
        segments is more than `perp_dist_weight` times the distance between the
        intersection of the perpendicular line at the end of the line segment
        and the segments, the perpendicular intersection will be used instead.
    inflate : bool
        If set to true the fit lines will be moved to the furthest outside
        point.
